  push:
    branches: [ "main" ] # Assumes your main branch is "main"

jobs:
  build:
    # This build will run on a free Linux server in the cloud
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    # 1. Checks out your repository's code onto the server

      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # 2. Sets up the Java (JDK) environment needed for Android
    - name: Set up Java
      uses: actions/setup-java@v4
      with:

    # 4. Gives permission to the 'gradlew' file to run
    - name: Grant execute permission for gradlew
      run: chmod +x gradlew

    # 5. This is the command Android Studio would normally run
    - name: Build with Gradle
      run: ./gradlew build

    # 6. This saves the finished .apk file so you can download it
    - name: Upload APK
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: app-debug.apk # This will be the name of your download
